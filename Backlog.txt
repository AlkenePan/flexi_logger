For improved testability, 
* we could expose a hidden method in the reconf handle to 
* check if the expected traces and the written traces match, and panic otherwise.
* the method needs to take a specification of the expected traces [(module, level))
* and be able to parse the written traces
* this requires a significant change: the reconf handle so far only shares the LogSpecification
* with the FlexiLogger, but then needs also access to the FileLineWriter,
* and the FileLineWriter must in the end implement the check
